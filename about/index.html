          <h2>Hey! I'm Brandon</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated from UC riverside with a degree in psychology. While
            there I held research assistant positions in a visual cognition lab
            and action & cognition lab. My daily tasks were recruiting
            participants, running participants through experiments under the
            guidelines of the graduate students, and analyzing and interpreting
            data from experiments. After graduating from UCR I enrolled into
            Lambda school for their Ux Design program. I got into ux design
            because i wanted to combine problem solving, visual design into
            creating real products that people use in real life. What I'm
            reading right now: incognito, you look like a thing and i love you
            What I'm listening to: kaytranda ft kali uchis: 10%, her's- harvey,
