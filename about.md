## I'm Brandon. Nice to meet you!

I'm a product designer currently based in California. I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a degree in Psychology. While at UC Riverside, I was a research assistant in the Visual Cognition Lab and Lab for Cognition and Action.

While working in these labs I learned that understanding people’s individual experiences is a crucial step in creating meaningful design. After graduating, I was fortunate enough to work at [ConnectOurKids]({% link work/connect-our-kids.md %}) building their mobile app.

## Why design?

I love to build things. Seeing something come alive from a sketch or simple idea into a digital (or tangible) reality is very fulfilling. For me design is a way to solve problems that have the opportunity to affect people's lives, whether it be in a small or big way.

## Say hello!

I am a team player and always looking to take on new challenges. I am currently open to opportunities, so if you’re interested in working together, please feel free to [email me]({% link contact.md %}).
