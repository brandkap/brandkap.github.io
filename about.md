## I'm Brandon. <br class="md:hidden"/> Nice to meet you!

I'm a product designer currently based in California. I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a degree in Psychology.

While at UC Riverside, I was a research assistant in the Visual Cognition Lab and Lab for Cognition and Action.

While working in these labs I learned that understanding people’s individual experiences is a crucial step in creating meaningful design.

After graduating, I was fortunate enough to work at [ConnectOurKids]({% link work/connect-our-kids.md %}) building their mobile app.

## Why design?

I love to build things. Seeing something come alive from a sketch or simple idea into a digital (or tangible) reality is very fulfilling.

For me design is a way to solve problems that have the opportunity to affect people's lives, whether it be in a small or big way.

## Say hello!

I am always looking to take on new challenges and am currently open to opportunities.

If you’re interested in working together, don't hesitate to [email me]({% link contact.html %})!
