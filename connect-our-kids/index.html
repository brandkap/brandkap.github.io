    <h1>ConnectOurKids</h1>
    <p>ConnectOurKids provides tools for social workers on their mission to place foster children into permanent homes.  This project was advised by Travis Collins, the stakeholder and CTO of ConnectOurKids.</p>

    <p>Role: UI/UX, Prototyping, User testing</p>
    <p>Timeframe: Dec 2019 - Feb 2020</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>ConnectOurkids is an organization whose goal is to connect foster children with a permanent home. With ConnectOurKids only existing as a website, this proves difficult for social workers when they are out in the field because they do not have access to the same tools as they would if they were in front of a computer. This app aims to solve that problem.</p>

    <p>Our goal was to incorporate key features from the website onto the mobile app.</p>

    <p>The app will have all the same tools and features needed for a social worker to perform their job as efficiently as possible. Having an app with the same functionality as the ConnectourKids website expedites the process of findng permanent homes for foster children.</p>
