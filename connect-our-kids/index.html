          <p>
            Connectourkids is a non-profit organization that aims to connect
            foster children with a permanent home. Their organization provides
            free tools to social workers to help expedite their work. Our goal
            was to take the main features of the ConnectOurKids website and
            create a mobile app incorporating those features. We had weekly
            meetings with the CTO of ConnectOurKids.

        <h2>Social workers lack mobile tools</h2>
        <p>
          ConnectOurKids provides free tools to social workers, but the dilemna
          is that these tools can only be accessed when in front of a desktop
          computer.The limitation of tools available to social workers in a
          mobile setting makes the process of finding permanent homes for foster
          children more delayed than necessary.There is a gap in the work flow
          of a social worker from the lack of having mobile tools.

          By exploring features on the website and using information given to

          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the CTO and an understanding of the work
          flow of social workers based off the wesbite we were able to layout
          the most important features.

          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. We had to create a mobile experience that maintained the same
          functionality and organization as the website, while keeping an eye
          our for problems on the website that could be improved on a mobile
          experience. The two main features we worked on were People search and
          Family connections.
