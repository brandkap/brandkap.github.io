            is an organization that aims to connect foster children with a
            permanent home. Their organization provides free tools to social
            workers to help expedite their work. Our goal was to take the main
            tools and features of the ConnectOurKids website and convert them
            into a mobile app. We had weekly meetings with the CTO of
            ConnectOurKids.

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          The ConnectOurKids tools only exist in a desktop version.
          ConnectOurKids provides tools to social workers, but when they are out
          in the field they do not have access to these tools because they are
          not in a mobile format. This creates a gap in a social worker's
          workflow which decreases their efficiency in the mission of matching
          foster children with permanent homes.

        <h2>How do social workers use ConnectOurKids?</h2>
        <p>
          Before jumping into designing mobile layouts it was necessary to
          define the product that ConnectOurKids provides. By exploring features
          on the website and using information given to our team by the CTO we
          were able to identify the 4 main ways social workers utilize the
          ConnectOurKids tools:
        </p>
      </div>

      <img class="chart" src="/images/needsside.png" />

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Reviewing existing designs</h2>
        <p>
          The desktop tools were reviewed in depth to make sure we transferred
          all necessary components. For each feature of the ConnectOurKids
          website notes were made of the layout, typography, colors, and flows.
          This review helped us brainstorm ways to convert the layout to mobile
          and find areas to incorporate improvements on the designs. Here are
          the desktop versions of the two main tools:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>1. People Search</h2>
        <p>
          People Search is the way social workers find extended family of foster
          children. Potential candidates for a permanent home can be located
          through here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img class="chart2" src="/images/Desktopbreakv3.png" />
      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>2. Family Connections</h2>
        <p>
          A family connection is anybody who is related to a foster child that
          has the potential to be a permanent guardian. The Family Connections
          tab contains the files and any other associated information for a
          foster child and their family connections. Social workers can log past
          engagements, upload documents, and edit contact details here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img class="chart2" src="/images/FamConbreak3.png" />

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>New design system</h2>
        <p>
          Our interface choices were based on the design elements already
          present on the website. We did not want to reinvent the wheel and have
          the apps UI vary drastically. So, in order to keep the experience
          similar between the website and mobile app we used the same copy,
          color schemes, typeface, and navigation layout as much as possible.
          Although, some of these aspects were changed to improve overall
          consistency, clarity, and hierarchy. <br />
          <br />
          Our goals for creating a new design system were to:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Create components that could transfer to desktop easily
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce unnecessary text and color styles
          </li>
          <li>Have consistent UI across all tools</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <img class="chart" src="/images/colorchoice.png" />
      <div class="center-text">
        <p>
          The website used several shades of blue for actionable buttons, so we
          opted to use only one shade of blue that meet all accessibility
          standards. <br />
          <br />
          This narrowing of text styles and color schemes resulted in a more
          consistent design system and makes the lives of developers easier when
          coding these designs and future designs.

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Creating a mobile experience</h2>
        <p>
          Taking into account all notes made from the website review and the
          updated design system we were able to craft the mobile experience.
          Inconsistent navigation UI across pages, font colors, and several
          shades of blue were updated with reusable components and fewer styles.

          <h2>People Search</h2>
          <p>
            The 5 searching criteria were placed into a top navigation bar with
            a clear selected state. <br /><br />A highly visible tutorial button
            is present so that a new user does not have to go searching for tool
            instructions. <br /><br />
            Search results are displayed in a pop up allowing for a quick return
            back to the search home.

          <h2>Editing Family Connections</h2>
          <p>
            The Family Connections section contains all information related to
            contacts for a foster child. A social worker can access phone
            numbers, addresses, emails, and much more. There is also the option
            to update any information for a family connection.
            <br /><br />
            We designed this section to resemble and have similar patterns to
            that a phone contact. The information in the editing screen was
            divided into sections to make finding particular information faster.

          <h2>Organizing Family Connections</h2>
          <p>
            This is a new feature we designed exclusively for the mobile app. A
            lack of a way to organize search results prompted discussion for
            filtering methods. <br /><br />
            A color filtering system was put in place to make identifying
            different types of family candidates easier. Each color corresponds
            to the current status of a family connection. <br />
            <br />Social workers can now filter and quickly identify what type
            of family connection they are viewing.

        <h2>Validating our designs</h2>
        <p>
          Usability testing was conducted with 3 social workers using a high
          fidelity prototype. In order to gain diversity in feedback received we
          recruited the social workers from various departments of social work.
          The tasks given to participants were similar to experiences a social
          worker would have on a day to day basis.<br /><br />
          Our goals of user tesing were to identify pain points that could be
          improved in future iterations, see if participants familiarity with
          the ConnectOurKids website transferred into easy use of the app, and
          get feedback on how the app would fit into the participants work
          flows.
          <br />
          <br />
          Participants were given the tasks of:

      </div>
       <div class="center-text">
        <p>
          Although the testing went smoothly, running the participants through
          these tasks still taught us a few things and pointed us to update some
          items:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any "Apply" or "Save" buttons were moved from the bottom of the page
            to the top right corner. This allowed users to save any edits
            without having the scroll to the bottom of the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            2
          </li>

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Measuring success</h2>
        <p>
          How do we know if the app is providing value? These are some metrics
          that I would want to look into after the app has been released to
          determine how much value social workers are getting out of the app:

          Our team was able to establish a design system, convert the
          ConnectOurKids desktop tools into mobile format, and eventually ship a
          working product, which you can

        <h2>Future directions</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward and thinking about ConnectOurKids as a whole I think a
          good direction would be to update the website to same level of design
          consistency as the app. The issues found regarding color schemes,
          typography, reusable components, and interactions on the website were
          left untouched on the website. <br />
          <br />Updating the desktop tools will create a more consistent
          experience between desktop and mobile which would hopefully translate
          into an easier workflow for social workers.
