            is a non-profit organization that aims to connect foster children
            with a permanent home. Their organization provides free tools to
            social workers to help expedite their work. Our goal was to take the
            main tools and features of the ConnectOurKids website and convert
            them into a mobile format. We had weekly meetings with the CTO of
            ConnectOurKids.

        Problem
      </h2> -->

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          While ConnectOurKids provide desktop tools, the lack of these tools in
          a mobile format creates delays in the workflows of social workers.
          These delays results in longer times Social workers dont have mobile
          tool ConnectOurKids provides free tools to social workers, but the
          dilemna is that these tools can only be accessed when in front of a
          desktop computer. <br /><br />
          This lack of mobile tools results in a delyaed work flow which affects
          the speed in which permanent homes are found for foster children. The
          limitation of tools available to social workers in a mobile setting
          makes the process of finding permanent homes for foster children more
          delayed than necessary. There is a gap in the work flow of a social
          worker from the lack of having mobile tools.

        <h2>How do social workers use ConnectOurKids?</h2>
        <p>
          Before jumping into designing mobile layouts it was necessary to
          define the product that ConnectOurKids provides. By exploring features
          on the website and using information given to our team by the CTO we
          were able to identify the 4 main ways social workers utilize the
          ConnectOurKids tools:

        <h2>Providing value to social workers</h2>
        <p class="details">
          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the CTO and an understanding of the work
          flow of social workers based off the wesbite we were able to layout
          the most important features.

        <h2>Reviewing existing designs</h2>
        <p>
          Reviewing the website designs in depth was done to make sure we
          transfered all necessary components of the tools. For each feature of
          the ConnectOurKids website notes were of the layout, typography,
          colors, flows. and more. While reviewing the website design it was
          clear that there was a lot of room for improvement. This review helped
          us brainstorm ways to convert the layout to mobile and find areas to
          incorporate improvements on the designs:

        <h2>People search</h2>
        <p>
          People search is the way social workers find extendeded family of
          foster children. Potential candidates for a permanent home can be
          located through here.

        <h2>Family connections</h2>
        <p>
          A family connection is anybody who is related to a foster child that
          has the potential to be a permanent guardian to that foster child. The
          Family Connections tab contains the files and any other associated
          information of foster children. Social workers can log past
          engagements, upload documents, and edit contact details of family
          connections.

        <h2>New design system</h2>
        <p>
          Our interface choices were based on the design elements already
          present on the website. We did not want to reinvent the wheel and have
          the apps UI vary drastically. So in order to keep the experience as
          similar as possible between the website and mobile app we use the same
          using consistent: copy, color schemes, typeface, and navigation
          layout.
        </p>

        <p>
          The website used several shades of blue for actionable buttons, so we
          opted to use only one shade of blue that meet all accessibility
          standards. The image below is a small sample of mobile for the new
          ConnectOurKids design system. <br />
          The website had 6 different instances of blue. . The image below is a
          small sample of mobile for the new ConnectOurKids design system. This
          narrow of design components is benefcial for and also made the lives
          of the developers easier when coding these designs and future designs.

        <h2>Creating a mobile experience</h2>
        <p>
          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. <br /><br />We had to create a mobile experience that
          maintained the same functionality and organization as the website,
          while keeping an eye our for problems on the website that could be
          improved on a mobile experience.

            present so that a social worker can begin a new search quickly
            without having to delete each Search results are displayed in a pop

            This is a new feature we made exclusively for the mobile app. A lack
            of a way to organize search results prompted discussion for
            filtering methods. <br /><br />There needed to be a way for social
            workers to distinguish each family connection, so we put in place a
            color filtering system. Family candidates are sorted into 6
            different types. Social workers can then filter and quickly identify
            what type of family connection they are viewing.

        <h2>Validating our designs</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted user testing with 3 social workers using a high fidelity
          prototype. We recruited 3 social workers that work in various
          departments of social work to gain insight from multiple
          perspectives.<br /><br />
          In order to maximize the diversity of feedback received we recruited 3
          social workers from different areas of the field. They worked in the
          areas of blank, blank, and blank. the tasks given to particiapnts were
          very similar to an experience a social worker would have when
          actualliny working in the field. Our main goals of user tesing were to
          identify pain points that could be improved in future iterations, see
          if participants familiarity with the ConnectOurKids website
          transferred into easy use of the app, and get feedback on how the app
          would fit into the participants work flows.

          Participants were given the tasks of:

          Collaboration made working on this projecta breeze. We involved the
          developers from the get go regarding the designs, why certain
          directions were chosen over others, and us asking them what any
          constraints they had regrading coding.

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Future directions</h2>
        <p>
          As far as the future of ConnectoutKids is concerned I think striving
          for consistency between the app and website is a great movie. Thinking
          about ConnectOurKids as a whole I think a good next move would be to
          update the website to same level of design consistency as the app. The
          issues found regarding color schemes, typography, reusable components,
          and interactions on the website were left untouched. I think a good
          direction to take would be to update the website tools to a higher
          level of design and functionality.
