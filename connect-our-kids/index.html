            is a non-profit organization that aims to connect foster children
            with a permanent home. Their organization provides free tools to
            social workers to help expedite their work. Our goal was to take the
            main tools and features of the ConnectOurKids website and convert
            them into a mobile format. We had weekly meetings with the CTO of
            ConnectOurKids.

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          Social workers lack mobile tool ConnectOurKids provides free tools to
          social workers, but the dilemna is that these tools can only be
          accessed when in front of a desktop computer. The limitation of tools
          available to social workers in a mobile setting makes the process of
          finding permanent homes for foster children more delayed than
          necessary. There is a gap in the work flow of a social worker from the
          lack of having mobile tools.

        <p>
          By exploring features on the website and using information given to
          our team by the CTO we were able to identify the 4 main ways social
          worker utilize the ConnectOurKids tools:

          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the CTO and an understanding of the work
          flow of social workers based off the wesbite we were able to layout
          the most important features.

          For each feature of the ConnectOurKids website we made notes of the
          layout, UI, flows. This helped us brainstorm ways to convert the
          layout to mobile and find areas to improve on the designs:

        <h2>People search</h2>
        <p>
          People search is the way social workers find extended family of foster
          children. Potential candidates for a permanent home can be located
          through here.

        <h2>Creating a mobile experience</h2>
        <p>
          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. We had to create a mobile experience that maintained the same
          functionality and organization as the website, while keeping an eye
          our for problems on the website that could be improved on a mobile
          experience.

            Potential candidates for a foster child can be located through here
            using 5 different searching criteria. A clear button is present so
            that a social worker can begin a new search quickly without having
            to delete each Search results are displayed in a pop up that allows
            for a quick return back to the search home.

            numbers, addresses, emails, and much more. There is also the option
            to update any informaation for a family connection.

          <h2>Organizing family connections</h2>
          <p>
            This is a new feature we made exclusively for the mobile app. A lack
            of a way to organize search results prompted discussion for
            filtering methods. There needed to be a way for social workers to
            distinguish each family connection, so we put in place a color
            filtering system. Family candidates are sorted into 6 different
            types. Social workers can then filter and quickly identify what type
            of family connection they are viewing.

        <h2>New design system</h2>
        <p>
          Our interface choices were based on the design elements already
          present on the website. We did not want to reinvent the wheel and have
          the apps UI vary drastically. So in order to keep the experience as
          similar as possible between the website and mobile app we use the same
          using consistent: copy, color schemes, typeface, and navigation
          layout. The website used several shades of blue for actionable
          buttons, so we opted to use only one shade of blue that meet all
          accessibility standards. The image below is a small sample of mobile
          for the new ConnectOurKids design system.

          We conducted user testing with a high fidelity prototype once we had a
          prototype ready we got in contact with 3 social workers to have them
          do certain tasks. We recruited 3 social workers that work in various
          positions as to gain insight from multiple perspectives. Our main
          goals of user tesing were to identify pain points that could be
          improved in future iterations, see if participants familiarity with
          the ConnectOurKids website transferred into easy use of the app, and
          get feedback on how the app would fit into the participants work
          flows.

          direction to update the website tools to a higher level.
