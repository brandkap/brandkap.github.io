        <h2>The problem: Lack of mobile tools</h2>
        <p class="details">
          ConnectOurKids provides free tools to social workers, but the dilemna
          is that these tools can only be accessed when in front of a desktop
          computer.The limitation of tools available to social workers in a
          mobile setting makes the process of finding permanent homes for foster
          children more delayed than necessary.There is a gap in the work flow
          of a social worker from the lack of having mobile tools.

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Providing value to social workers</h2>
        <p class="details">
          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the CTO and an understanding of the work
          flow of social workers based off the wesbite we were able to layout
          the most important features.

            The ways in which a social workers need to be able to use this app
            were separated into 3 main categories:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Search for people in the ConnectOurKids database</li>

        <h2>Creating a mobile experience</h2>
        <p>
          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. Our goal was to create a mobile experience that maintained
          the same functionality and organization as the website. We also made
          sure to keep an eye out for opportunites to optimize and improve the
          experience. The two main features we worked on were People Search and
          Family Connections.

          <ul>
            <li>
              There should be more a consistent color scheme; there are too many
              shades of blue
            </li>
            <li>
              Clearer indication of what searching criteria is selected
            </li>
            <li>
              Text input fields should be separated
            </li>
            <li>
              Drop down menu selectors for city and state would save the
              headache of having to type out the entire city/state

          <h2>Organizing Family Connections</h2>
          <p class="details">
            A family connection is a potential candidate to provide permanent
            housing. Family candidates can be sorted into 6 different types.
            There needed to be a way to distinguish each family candidate, so a
            color system was created so that a social worker can filter and
            quickly identify what type of family connection they are viewing.

            Our interface choices were based on the design elements already
            present on the website. We did not want to reinvent the wheel and
            have the app vary drastically. So in order to keep the experience as
            similar as possible between the website and mobile app we use the
            same using consistent: Copy, Color schemes, Typeface, Navigation
            layout
