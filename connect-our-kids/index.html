          <p>
            Connectourkids is a non-profit organization that aims to connect
            foster children with a permanent home. Their organization provides
            free tools to social workers to help expedite their work. Our goal
            was to take the main features of the ConnectOurKids website and
            create a mobile app incorporating those features while finding
            opportunities to improve the experience. We had weekly meetings with
            the CTO of ConnectOurKids.

        Problem

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Social workers lack mobile tools</h2>
        <p>
          ConnectOurKids provides free tools to social workers, but the dilemna
          is that these tools can only be accessed when in front of a desktop
          computer. The limitation of tools available to social workers in a
          mobile setting makes the process of finding permanent homes for foster
          children more delayed than necessary. There is a gap in the work flow
          of a social worker from the lack of having mobile tools.

        <h2>How do social workers use ConnectOurKids?</h2>
        <p>
          By exploring features on the website and using information given to
          our team by the CTO we were able to identify the 4 main ways a social
          workers utilizes the ConnectOurKids tools:

        <h2>Providing value to social workers</h2>
        <p class="details">
          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the CTO and an understanding of the work
          flow of social workers based off the wesbite we were able to layout
          the most important features.

        <h2>Reviewing the existing designs</h2>
        <p class="middlepara">
          For each feature of the ConnectOurKids website we made notes of the
          layout, UI, flows. This helped us brainstorm ways to convert the
          layout to mobile and find areas to improve on the designs:

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>1. People search</h2>
        <p>
          People search is the way social workers find extended family of foster
          children. Potential candidates for a permanent home can be located
          through here.

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>2. Family connections</h2>
        <p>
          Family Connections contains the files of foster children. Social
          workers can log past engagements, upload files, and edit contact
          details for family connections.

        <p class="middlepara">
          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. We had to create a mobile experience that maintained the same
          functionality and organization as the website, while keeping an eye
          our for problems on the website that could be improved on a mobile
          experience. The two main features we worked on were People search and
          Family connections.

            needed to be a way for social workers to distinguish each family
            candidate, so we put in place a color system so that Family
            candidates can be sorted into 6 different types. Social workers can
            filter and quickly identify what type of family connection they are
            viewing.

          Our interface choices were based on the design elements already

          the apps UI vary drastically. So in order to keep the experience as
          similar as possible between the website and mobile app we use the same
          using consistent: copy, color schemes, typeface, and navigation
          layout. The website so we opted to use one shade of blue that meet all
          accessibility standards

          We conducted user testing with a high fidelity prototype once we had a
          prototype ready we got in contact with 3 social workers to have them
          do certain tasks. Our participants worked in the fields of
          maintainging relationships with the foster children, a focus on
          building family connecttions, Our main goals of user tesing were to
          identify pain points that could be improved in future iterations, see
          if participants familiarity with the ConnectOurKids website
          transferred into easy use of the app, and get feedback on how the app
          would fit into the participants work flows.
