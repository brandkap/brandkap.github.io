        <h2>The problem: Lack of mobile tools</h2>
        <p class="details">
          ConnectOurKids provides free tools to social workers, but the dilemna
          is that these tools can only be accessed when in front of a desktop
          computer.The limitation of tools available to social workers in a
          mobile setting makes the process of finding permanent homes for foster
          children more delayed than necessary.

        <h2>Providing value to social workers</h2>
        <p class="details">
          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the CTO and an understanding of the work
          flow of social workers based off the wesbite we were able to layout
          the most important features.

          <p class="details">
            The ways in which a social workers need to be able to use this app
            were separated into 3 main categories:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Search for people in the ConnectOurKids database</li>
            <li>
              Add and edit contact information for potential family candidates
            </li>
            <li>
              Log past and ongoing activity/engagements with family candidates.

          <h2>People search</h2>
          <p class="details">
            A key component of ConnectOurKids is the ability to search for
            people out of massive database of over 3 billion people. Beign able
            to search by multiple criteria are needed to expand searching
            capabilities. Social workers have 5 options of searching available:
            • Name • Email •Address •Phone number •Social profile link or URL
            Frequent searching Because there are multiple text fields for some
            searching options, having to delete each field to begin a new search
            would be a hassle. So, a clear button was put in place Social
            workers need to be able to start a new search quickly. The presence
            of a clear button is due to the frequent need for users to begin a
            search with a new information. It is necessary for the social
            workers entirely clear their previous search with one click. People
            unfamiliar with the searching features need a quick tutorial. The
            button for the introduction video will disappear after the tutorial
            has been watched.

          <h2>Organizing family connections</h2>
          <p class="details">
            A family connection is a potential candidate to provide permanent
            housing. Family candidates can be sorted into 6 different types.
            There needed to be a way to distinguish each family candidate, so a
            color system was created so that a social worker can filter and
            quickly identify what type of family connection they are viewing.

            Our interface choices were based on the design elements already

            have the app vary drastically. So in order to keep the experience as
            similar as possible between the website and mobile app we use the
            same using consistent: Copy, Color schemes, Typeface, Navigation
