        <h2>Providing value to social workers</h2>
        <p class="details">
          Before designing any screens it was important to define the key
          features and understand how social workers would get value out of the
          app. Through discussions with the stakeholder and understanding of the
          work flow of social workers we were able to layout the most important
          features.

        <p class="details">
          The ways in which a social workers need to be able to use this app
          were separated into 3 main categories: 1.Search for people in the
          ConnectOurKids database 2.Add and edit contact information for
          potential family candidates 3.Log past and ongoing
          activity/engagements with family candidates.

          <p class="details">
            Multiple searching riteria are needed to expand searching
            capabilities. 5 options of searching are available: • Name • Email •
            Address • Phone number •Social profile link or URL Frequent
            searching Social workers need to be able to start a new search
            quickly. The presence of a clear button is due to the frequent need
            for users to begin a search with a new information. It is necessary
            for the social workers entirely clear their previous search with one
            click. People unfamiliar with the searching features need a quick
            tutorial. The button for the introduction video will disappear after
            the tutorial has been watched.
