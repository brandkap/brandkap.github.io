            is a non-profit organization that aims to connect foster children
            with a permanent home. Their organization provides free tools to
            social workers to help expedite their work. Our goal was to take the
            main features of the ConnectOurKids website and create a mobile app
            incorporating those features while finding opportunities to improve
            the experience. We had weekly meetings with the CTO of
            ConnectOurKids.

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>Scheduling aperiodic events on Google calendars takes forever.
          Coordinating schedules across the district level, school level,
          department level is difficult for school staff. In this case, our
          stakeholder, who is a teacher and basketball coach, has to frequently
          coordinate sporting events at various levels with distinct dates and
          frequencies. <br />
          <br />Google calendars is the main calendar used by teacher staff, but
          there is one specific area on Google calendars that causes a lot of
          trouble for those scheduling events. When a user wants to schedule an
          event that falls under an inconsistent pattern of days, or
          aperiodicly, google calendars does not support a fast way to do this.
          Even in the custom recurrence menu, your event must fall under
          consistent days across one or multiple weeks.

          <br />
          <br />
          In the image below, we can see that when creating a reoccuring event
          in GC it must land on consistent repeating days. One cannot schedule
          an event on MWF on one week and then TWF on the next week. This
          inability to schedule events in an aperiodic format causes major
          delays in event planning.

        <h2>User interviews & feedback</h2>
        <p>
          User interviews and surveys were conducted to gain understanding for
          how teachers and coaches use their calendars. This guided the planning
          phase and brainstorming features. Based on what I learned I identified
          a few key tasks: ‍ Choose dates for an event Edit any past made events
          Share an event with a group of contacts Assign a group/groups to an
          event ‍ With these task outlined there were two high level design
          goals: 1. Design all the basic functionalities of a calendar for
          mobile format 2. Enchance on the basics to support aperiodic events
          and rapid collaboration

          We decided to move foward with a calendar layout that allow for a
          preview of events, does not vary radically from the google calendar
          design, and has a clearly defined area of clickability for date
          selection.

          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. We had to create a mobile experience that maintained the same
          functionality and organization as the website, while keeping an eye
          our for problems on the website that could be improved on a mobile
          experience. The two main features we worked on were People search and
          Family connections.

            The goal was to allow total control over the date selection process
            in a way that does not have have to adhere to a specific pattern of
            days. This was done through a “click and pick” type selector. Simply
            click the dates in any frequency or pattern to schedule an event on
            that day.
