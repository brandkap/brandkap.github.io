        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          Scheduling aperiodic events on Google Calendar is very difficult to
          do. An aperiodic event is an event that has an inconsistent pattern of
          days. When scheduling an event aperiodically, Google Calendar does not
          support a fast way to do this. In this case, our stakeholder, Craig,
          who is a teacher and basketball coach, has to frequently coordinate
          sporting events at various levels with distinct dates and frequencies.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>
          Where does Google Calendar go wrong?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the image below, we can see that when creating a custom reccuring
          event in Google Calendar it must fall under a consistent pattern
          across multiple weeks. Scheduling an event on Mon,Wed,Fri on one week
          and then Tues,Thurs,Fri on the next week has to be done by creating
          two completely separate events. This inability to schedule events in
          an aperiodic format causes major delays in event planning.

        <h2>Interviews & market research</h2>
        <p>
          I began this project with surveys and market research to clearly
          define pain points and what role DatePicker will play in the event
          planning process. Surveys were given to 32 teachers and coaches which
          provided data as to what products teachers currently use as their main
          calendar and how they use these calendars. I conducted a competitive
          analysis with calendars products such as iCal, BAND, Checker Plus, and
          more to get an idea of current solutions on the market regarding event
          planning.<br />
          <br />From the research I concluded that:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Majority of teachers from our sample exclusively use Google
            Calendars
          </li>
          <li>
            DatePicker will<b> not be built to replace Google Calendar,</b>
            but to complement it
          </li>
          <li>
            There is <b>no available solution on the market </b>for this
            specific problem space
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Design Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Using the research as a guideline, I identified a few problem
          statements and proposed solutions to address user needs. Our
          stakeholder, Craig, was used as our persona because he was a great
          representation of the needs that a user would have when event
          planning.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="center-text">
        <p>
          By determining where the pain points were in the event planning
          process and brainstorming solutions for them, I was able to determine
          the main features of DatePicker:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose dates for event in any pattern of frequency</li>
          <li>Allow collaboration by assigning groups to an event</li>

          <li>Provide push notifications for event changes to group members</li>
          <li>
            Transfer events made on DatePicker to users connected Google account
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Exploring calendar layouts</h2>
        <p class="middlepara">
          We decided to move forward with a calendar layout that allow for a
          preview of events, does not vary radically from the google calendar
          design, and has a clearly defined area of clickability for date
          selection. Layout C also happens to be the same calendar style as
          Google Calendar, allowing for users familiarity of that calendar to
          transfer over.

        <h2>Confirming dates</h2>
        <p class="middlepara">
          There was one step in the flow of creating a event that I was
          particularly interested in testing because it is not present in Google
          Calendar. The final step in the flow for scheduling an event is to
          confirm the dates. Rather than make the user remember the event name
          and times chosen in the previous screen, that information is place to
          the confirmation button. I waited until the high fidelity phase to do
          rapid user testing 5 participants for several iterations of a
          confirmation button.

          <br /><br />
          The three main areas in question were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Button clarity
          </li>
          <li>
            Where to place the button
          </li>
          <li>Shape of container for the info and button</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <img class="chart2" src="/images/confirmbutton3.png" />

      <div class="center-text">
        <p class="middlepara">
          Receiving feedback and observing people interact with all the
          iterations showed that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Option A's button resulted in awkward positions for scrolling
            through the calendar and accidental clicks
          </li>
          <li>
            The buttons for options B and D did not immediately strike people as
            something that was clickable
          </li>
          <li>
            Options C and E provided a nice balance between location, touch area
            size for easy clickability, and button clarity
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          With options C and E being very similar, I ended up moving foward with
          Option E because the circular pill shape provided more visual contrast
          amongst the square grid calendar shape.

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Key flow</h2>
        <p class="middlepara">
          Since DatePicker is solving a very niche pain point in Google
          Calendar, the functionality is much simpler than a comprehensive
          calendar app. Even though in terms of functionality it is simple,
          mapping out the flows was important to determine the necessary
          screens.

            This simple interaction shows is the most important part of

          I ran final usability testing with a high fidelity prototype amongst 7
          participants that includedteachers and coaches. Based on feedback and

          incorporate into the final designs that have the potential to make
          DatePicker easier and faster to use.

          of the app, along with scattered colored squares to represent the
          purpose and function of DatePicker. Incorporating both primary colors
          from the app into the logo creates a cohesive look and feel between
          the logo and app.

          DatePicker was an learning experience to work on because it was a
          great example on how sometimes a solution to a problem does not have
          to be fancy or complex. It was great to receive positive feedback from
          the stakeholder and see how such a frustrating problem in widely used
          product could be resolved with a straightfoward solution.
          <br /><br />
          Our team was able to get DatePicker into a deployable stage, but there
          has yet to be a planned release date for it onto the app store.
          Hopefully the next team that works on DatePicker can plan for a
          release because due to discussion with teachers and coaches DatePicker
          could provide a lot of value to their event planning experience.
