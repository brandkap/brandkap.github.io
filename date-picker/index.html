            DatePicker is an event planner that serves as an extension to Google
            Calendar. DatePicker contains tools for customizable date selection

        <h2>Why do we need another calendar tool?</h2>
        <p>
          Scheduling aperiodic events on Google Calendar is very difficult to
          do. When a user wants to schedule an event that falls under an
          inconsistent pattern of days, or aperiodicly, Google Calendar does not
          support a fast way to do this. Even in the custom recurrence menu,
          your event must fall under consistent days across one or multiple
          weeks. Coordinating schedules across the district level, school level,
          department level is a hassle for school staff. In this case, our
          stakeholder, who is a teacher and basketball coach, has to frequently
          coordinate sporting events at various levels with distinct dates and
          frequencies.

          <br />
          <br />
          In the image below, we can see that when creating a reoccuring event
          in Google Calendar it must land on consistent repeating days.
          Scheduling an event on MWF on one week and then TWF on the next week
          has to be done completely separately. This inability to schedule
          events in an aperiodic format causes major delays in event planning.
        </p>

      <img class="chart" src="/images/gcdate.png" />
      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>
          Provide a way to schedule custom events while collaborating with
          groups. In addition to this, editing past made events with changes
          notifications being pushed to th egroups associcated with that events.
          The goal for DatePicker serves to be a stripped down version of Google
          Calendar with increased customization options for date selection.
          DatePicker pushes all added events to the users connected Google
          account.

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>User interviews & feedback</h2>
        <p>
          User interviews and surveys were conducted to gain understanding for
          how teachers and coaches use their current calendars. This guided the
          planning phase and brainstorming of features. Based on what I learned
          I identified a few key tasks: ‍ Choose dates for an event Edit any
          past made events Share an event with a group of contacts Assign a
          group/groups to an event ‍ With these task outlined there were two
          high level design goals: 1. Design all the basic functionalities of a
          calendar for mobile format 2. Enchance on the basics to support
          aperiodic events and rapid collaboration.
          <br />
          <br />
          These surveys and interviews helped determine what aspects of event
          planning are essential for DatePicker and which are secondary.

          We decided to move foward with a calendar layout that allow for a
          preview of events, does not vary radically from the google calendar
          design, and has a clearly defined area of clickability for date
          selection. Layout C also happens to be the same calendar style as
          Google Calendar, allowing for users familiariy of that calnedar to
          transfer over.

        <h2>Confirming dates</h2>
        <p class="middlepara">
          The final step in the flow for scheduling an event is to confirm the
          dates. Rather than make the user remember the event name and times
          chosen in the previous screen while selecting dates, that information
          next to the button for confirming selected dates. User testing was
          done with 5 particicpants for several iterations of a confirmation
          button.

          <br /><br />
          The three main areas in question were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Button clarity

            Option A's button resulted in awkward positions for scrolling

            The buttons for Option B and D did not immediately strike people as
            something that was clickable
          </li>
          <li>
            Options C and E provided the best balance between location, touch
            area size for easy clickability,allowing space for natural scrolling
            finger movement, and button size and clarity,

            With Option C and E being very similar, I ended up moving foward

            This is the most important feature of DatePicker. Allowing fully
            customizable patterns of date selection solves the biggest pain
            point when using Google Calendar.
            <!--This could not be done from a
            selection of pre-made patterns, for example, every MWF or every
            other day, so a click and pick selector was implemented.-->
            The goal was to allow total control over the date selection process
            in a way that does not have have to adhere to a specific pattern of
            days. This was done by implementing h a “click and pick” type
            selector. Simply click the dates in any frequency or pattern to
            schedule an event on that day.

          logo needed some fresh paint. I incorporated the two primary colors of
          the app, along with a scattered selection of date to represent the
          purpose and function of DatePicker. Incorporating both primary colors
          from the app into the logo creates a cohesive look and feel between
          the logo and app.

          Hopefully the next team that works on DatePicker can plan for a
          release because due to disscussion with teachers and coaches
          DatePicker could provide a lot of value to their event planning
          experience.
