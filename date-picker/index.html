        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          Scheduling aperiodic events on Google calendars takes forever.
          Coordinating schedules across the district level, school level,
          department level is difficult for school staff. In this case, our
          stakeholder, who is a teacher and basketball coach, has to frequently
          coordinate sporting events at various levels with distinct dates and
          frequencies. <br />
          <br />Google calendars is the main calendar used by teacher staff, but
          there is one specific area on Google calendars that causes a lot of
          trouble for those scheduling events. When a user wants to schedule an
          event that falls under an inconsistent pattern of days, or
          aperiodicly, google calendars does not support a fast way to do this.
          Even in the custom recurrence menu, your event must fall under
          consistent days across one or multiple weeks.

          <br />
          <br />
          In the image below, we can see that when creating a reoccuring event
          in GC it must land on consistent repeating days. One cannot schedule
          an event on MWF on one week and then TWF on the next week. This
          inability to schedule events in an aperiodic format causes major
          delays in event planning.

        <h2>User interviews & feedback</h2>
        <p>
          User interviews and surveys were conducted to gain understanding for
          how teachers and coaches use their current calendars. This guided the
          planning phase and brainstorming of features. Based on what I learned
          I identified a few key tasks: ‍ Choose dates for an event Edit any
          past made events Share an event with a group of contacts Assign a
          group/groups to an event ‍ With these task outlined there were two
          high level design goals: 1. Design all the basic functionalities of a
          calendar for mobile format 2. Enchance on the basics to support
          aperiodic events and rapid collaboration.

            How we can give full control over the date selection process?
          </h2>
          <p class="gif-p">
            This is the most important feature of DatePicker. Allowing fully
            customizable patterns of date selection solves the biggest pain
            point when using Google Calendars.
            <!--This could not be done from a
            selection of pre-made patterns, for example, every MWF or every
            other day, so a click and pick selector was implemented.-->
            The goal was to allow total control over the date selection process
            in a way that does not have have to adhere to a specific pattern of
            days. This was done by implementing h a “click and pick” type
            selector. Simply click the dates in any frequency or pattern to
            schedule an event on that day.

            This subtle animation of the event sliding in indicates that the

          Our team was able to get DatePicker into a deployable stage, but there
          has yet to be a planned release date for it onto the app store.
          Hopefully the next team that works on DatePicker can plan for a
          release because due to disscussion with teachers and coaches
          DatePicker could provide a lot of value to their event planning
          experience.
