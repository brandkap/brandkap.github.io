        Problem
      </h2>

      <div class="center-text">
        <h2>Scheduling aperiodic events on Google calendars takes forever</h2>
        <p>
          There is one specific area on google calendars that causes a lot of
          trouble for those scheduling events. When a user wants to schedule an
          event that falls under an inconsistent pattern of days, or
          aperiodicly, google calendars does not support a fast way to do this.
          DatePicker is not meant to replace Google calendars, but to serve as
          an tool to solve a very specific pain point that people have with
          scheduling aperiodic events in google calendars. You cannot click and
          choose each day on the main calendar view i ngoogle calendars. You
          have to schedule an event that falls under a consistent frquency. Even
          in the custom recurrence menu, your event must fall under consistent
          days across multiple weeks.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the image below, we can see that when creating a reoccuring event
          in GC it must land on consistent repeating days with a week. I cannot
          schedule an event on MWF on one week and the TWF on the next week.
          This causes major delays in scheduling an event

          By exploring features on the website and using information given to
          our team by the CTO we were able to identify the 3 main ways a social
          workers utilizes the ConnectOurKids tools:

        <p>
          People search is the way social workers find extended family of foster
          children. Potential candidates for a permanent home can be located
          through here.

          Family Connections contains the files of foster children. Social
          workers can log past engagements, upload files, and edit contact
          details for family connections.

          Our reference for designing the mobile screens was the ConnectOurKids
          website. We reviewed the existing website designs, brainstormed ideas,
          and took notes of things we wanted to incorporate in the future mobile
          designs. We had to create a mobile experience that maintained the same
          functionality and organization as the website, while keeping an eye
          our for problems on the website that could be improved on a mobile
          experience. The two main features we worked on were People search and
          Family connections.

          the apps UI vary drastically. So in order to keep the experience as
          similar as possible between the website and mobile app we use the same
          using consistent: copy, color schemes, typeface, and navigation

          building family connecttions, Our main goals of user tesing were to
          identify pain points that could be improved in future iterations, see
          if participants familiarity with the ConnectOurKids website
          transferred into easy use of the app, and get feedback on how the app
